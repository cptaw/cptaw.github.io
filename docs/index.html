                    <p>The workshop themed <code>Cyber-physical Technologies for Affective Wellbeing</code> will take place on October 27th and 28th, 2023 in Nara, Japan.</p>
<h5 id="goal">Goal</h5>
<p>The workshop will provide an opportunity for young researchers to exchange their research progress and brainstorm about possible research directions to develop hardware and software that:
Bridges the real and the virtual worlds (a target of Society 5.0) by improving the quality of human-human and human-agent communication through behavioral and physiological cues.
Draws on quantitative measures to assess affective states, which are related to healthcare and well-being (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3#overview" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> SDG #3</a>
).</p>
<h5 id="significance">Significance</h5>
<p>Achieving a state of well-being is essential, and one of the United Nations SDGs. Physical and mental well-being are essential, together with a sense of fulfillment with one’s influence in the world. Part of this influence is social and achieved through communication. Augmenting communication through technologies is one of the goals of Society 5.0 proposed by the 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan. To enhance communication and create technologies that help us to understand and improve well-being, a multidisciplinary team is necessary.</p>
<p>This workshop will provide a medium to encourage exchange between engineering, computer science, and psychology researchers working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual avatar design and development</li>
<li>Non-verbal behavior analysis and synthesis</li>
<li>Speech analysis and synthesis</li>
<li>Facial expression understanding, recognition, and synthesis</li>
<li>Multimodal sensory analysis and Representation in virtual reality</li>
<li>Machine learning for human information processing</li>
<li>Emotion research</li>
<li>Affective computing</li>
<li>Natural language processing</li>
<li>Physiological-based human-computer interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>Talk title: <em><strong>Nonverbal Information  to Enrich Future Telecommunication ― Challenges utilizing both Cyber and Real Space</strong></em></p>
<p>The exchange of &ldquo;nonverbal information,&rdquo; which plays an important role
in everyday interpersonal communication, is also essential for
enriching telecommunications. Telecommunication systems that utilize
cyberspace, such as the Metaverse, which has been attracting attention
recently, are expected to be used more widely in the future, but there
are many issues to be overcome in order to realize rich communication
there. In this talk, the role of non-verbal information will be
reviewed, and the future of rich telecommunication through appropriate
transmission and reception of such information will be discussed.</p>

She has been tackling on complex concepts such as empathy, affect, personality and theory of mind in a variety of contexts such as healthcare, education and creativity. She plans to continue pursuing research to understand factors shaping people’s behaviors with their growing personal interactions with virtual agents and develop innovations that would have a positive effect on our society. She is also a proud member of Women in CS and Women in ML groups, and an advocate of Open Science and Open-Source Software.</p>

<p>Dr. Yoshiko Yabe is a researcher at the Department of Functional Brain Imaging, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST) in Chiba, Japan. She started her academic career as a Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo, Japan. She was working on the effect of body movement (treadmill walk) on visual motion perception. The relationship between body movements and perception/cognition has been one of my key research topics. Afterward, she became an assistant professor at Kochi University of Technology, where she became interested in another long-term research topic: time. During her second postdoc at Western University in Canada, she focused on how action changes timing perception via the striatal dopaminergic system. With her experience in cognitive neuroscience of the relationship between body movement and perception, she investigated cognitive capabilities to remember spatial and temporal information in athletes at NTT Communication Science Laboratories.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dr. Yung-Hao Yang is a researcher affiliated with a specific program in Kyoto University’s Graduate School of Informatics. He attained the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Psychology at National Taiwan University, with a focus on unconscious visual perception, particularly related to aspects like high-level semantics and emotions, by using a range of research methods such as psychophysical techniques, fMRI, ERP, and Eye-tracking systems.
Following his doctoral studies, he undertook the role of a research fellow at Harvard Medical School’s Visual Attention Lab, where he captivated the nature of human attention when exposed to unconventional stimuli, such as instances of instability. Additionally, he collaboratied with a Japanese company, where he conducted research into the effects of auditory information on pupil dilation. Currently, his research is centered on the perception of human motion within naturalistic scenes.</p>
