The workshop themed `Cyber-physical Technologies for Affective Wellbeing` will take place on October 27th and 28th, 2023 in Nara, Japan.

##### Goal
The workshop will provide an opportunity for young researchers to exchange their research progress and brainstorm about possible research directions to develop hardware and software that:
Bridges the real and the virtual worlds (a target of Society 5.0) by improving the quality of human-human and human-agent communication through behavioral and physiological cues.
Draws on quantitative measures to assess affective states, which are related to healthcare and well-being ({{<extlink text="SDG #3" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3#overview" icon="fa fa-external-link">}}).

##### Significance
Achieving a state of well-being is essential, and one of the United Nations SDGs. Physical and mental well-being are essential, together with a sense of fulfillment with oneâ€™s influence in the world. Part of this influence is social and achieved through communication. Augmenting communication through technologies is one of the goals of Society 5.0 proposed by the 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan. To enhance communication and create technologies that help us to understand and improve well-being, a multidisciplinary team is necessary.

This workshop will provide a medium to encourage exchange between engineering, computer science, and psychology researchers working on:

- Virtual avatar design and development
- Non-verbal behavior analysis and synthesis
- Speech analysis and synthesis
- Facial expression understanding, recognition, and synthesis
- Multimodal sensory analysis and Representation in virtual reality
- Machine learning for human information processing
- Emotion research
- Affective computing
- Natural language processing
- Physiological-based human-computer interaction
